# Quick_Math

This project is a simple project that I used to test out some features of java. 
I also wanted to create a useful calculator for doing quick and easy operations.

This project requires java installed which can be accessed through 
https://www.java.com/en/download/.

The calculator is only meant to perform basic integer operations, therefore dividing
a number will not return the remainder and per java restrictions will not be able to
calculate a number larger than 2^31.
